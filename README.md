# K-Means Clustering Algorithm

This project implements the K-Means clustering algorithm in **Java**. The program loads a file containing examples, executes the K-Means algorithm with M centroids, and finally saves the coordinates of the cluster centers. The initial position of each centroid is randomly selected from the examples.

#### Example Data

The input data file (data_file.txt) should contain examples in a specific format.

#### Implementation Details

The initial position of each centroid is randomly selected from the examples.

The clustering error is calculated using the Euclidean distance:

∣∣xi−μk∣∣2∣∣xi​−μk​∣∣2
